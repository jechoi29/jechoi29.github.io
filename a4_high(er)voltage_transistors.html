            <strong>Assignment Overview:</strong>
            Create a schematic, circuit, and code that uses a transistor to
            control load power separate from logic power. Use analogWrite(), a
            high-load output device, and an input sensor that uses a library.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>What I did:</strong> I chose the LED strip for my load. I
            used a remote to control for how the lights (both the LED strip and
            blue LED) will behave. When "0" is pressed on the remote controller,
            I made the lights turn off. When "1" is pressed, I made the lights
            turn on. When "2" is pressed, I made the lights blink. When "3" is
            pressed, I made the lights fade. <br /><br />
            I started by breaking down the setup of what I needed to include in
            the circuit. I began with understanding how to use the transistor
            and control the load power (the LED strips). I installed the LED
            strips onto my breadboard and used the Blink and Fade public ardiuno
            example codes to test if the LED strips were working appropriately.
            Then, I set up the IR Remote and Receiver and controlled the blue
            LED before I controlled the load power and worked with a higher
            voltage to be safe.

          <p>
            <br />
            I estimated whether the current from the LED strip to the transistor
            is a safe value without a resistor. I also calculated a desired
            resistance of equal to or less 20mA (0.02A) with the blue LED I've chosen.
            <br />
            Once I figured out the current from the LED strip, I realized that I
            didn't need to include additional resistance for the transistor.
            And, I chose 100 V/A for the blue LED.

            I followed the tutorial on <a
              href="http://www.circuitbasics.com/arduino-ir-remote-receiver-tutorial/"
              >Circuit Basics</a
            >
             about how to set up an IR Remote and Receiver and manipulated the
            example code to write my own firmwire that replicated what I wanted
            to do, incorporating the requirements that were mentioned above. I
            included the logic behind how I wanted my lights to behave for the
            blue LED first. Then, once I knew that my blue LED was working as
            expected, I handled the lights' behavior for the LED strips.

            <strong>Firmware (as a code snippet)</strong>

          <pre>
// imports the IR remote library
// to access necessary functions
#include <IRremote.h>

// constant variable for the IR receiver (sensor)
// that is connected to pin 7

// creates a variable to store IR receiver results 
decode_results results;

const int blueLED = 5;    
// analog PWM pin the LED strip attaches to
const int LEDstrip = 9;

// the setup routine runs once when pressed reset

  // start the receiving process

  // indicates whether the receiver detects a signal

  // initialize the blue LED (pin 5) as an output pin
  pinMode(blueLED, OUTPUT);
  // initialize the LED strip (pin 9) as an output pin
  pinMode(LEDstrip, OUTPUT);

void loop(){
  // if IR code is received (returns true),
  // executes and stores IR code in results;
  // if IR code is not received (returns false),
  // does not execute
  if (irrecv.decode(&results)){
    // prints IR code as HEX to Serial Monitor
    // for troubleshooting purposes
    Serial.println(results.value, HEX);
    // checks if IR code HEX is equal to the HEX
    // that corresponds to "0", turns lights off
    if (results.value == 0xFF6897) {

    // that corresponds to "3", fade lights
    if (results.value == 0xFF7A85) {
      // turn on blue LED and LED strip,
      // use a loop to decreases the brightness
      // of the LED by 5, which shows the fade effect
      for (int bright = 255; bright >= 0; bright-=5) {
        // blue LED's brightness decreases by 5
        analogWrite(blueLED, bright);
        // LED strip's brightness decreases by 5
        analogWrite(LEDstrip, bright);
        // wait for 25 milliseconds 
        delay(25);
      }
     }
    // resets the receiver to detect 
    // another signal IR code
    irrecv.resume();

            Special thanks and credits to Jasper for helping me understand why
            and how we use transitors, verify my circuit when trying to turn on
            the LED strips, and properly use my multimeter to measure the
            voltage and current of my circuit. Thank you, Jasper!
