            <strong>Final Project Overview:</strong>
            Integrate electronics skills into a PRODUCT.
            Take some input and connect that to some output through digital logic.
            Integrated the project into a prototype
            (so it cannot just be a breadboard on the table!)
            <br /><br />
            <strong>What I did:</strong> I used a DHT11 sensor (Temperature and Humidity Module),
            LCD Display (LCD1602 Module with pin header), and a red LED for my prototype. I used these
            components to detect the humidity levels in a room and signal
            whether the room's humidity is at its ideal state.
            The DHT11 sensor is the input, the red LED is the output, and the LCD Display
            provides additional information about the input (the temperature and humidity that the input senses).
            Based on online research, I found that the optimum humidity range for health and comfort is between 30% to 50%.
            Thus, I made the red LED light up when humidity is under 30% or over 50%, otherwise the red LED is off.
            The behavior of the red LED indicates whether I should turn on my dehumidifier.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Why I did it:</strong> I recently bought a dehumidifer for my room
            because my room tends to have high levels of humidity as condensation forms on my window sill.
            High humidity levels in the home can cause discomfort and damage the home.
            Too much moisture promotes the spread of mold, mildew, fungi, bacteria, and viruses.
            Knowing this, I didn't want the humidity of my room to affect my health and living conditions,
            which is why I thought it was reasonable to buy a dehumidifer. Unfortunetly,
            it was difficult to know whether my room was within the ideal humidity range, and
            I didn't want to turn the device on and off every day. So, I wanted to fix this
            problem with my prototype idea since I knew that my Arduino kit had a humidity sensor
            that I could utilize.
            <br /><br />
          </p><strong>Drawing the Concept</strong><p>
            I first drew out the concept, keeping the underlying requirements of the project in mind
            and reflecting upon the components I have available in my Arduino kit.
            The input is the DHT11 sensor detects the humidity and temperature of the room.
            The output is the red LED, and through digital logic, the red LED turns on when the humidity
            is not within the ideal humidity range (30-50% humidity levels). The LCD Display acts as additional information
            for the input that helps to understand the red LED's behavior and provides additional information around
            the temperature and humidity of the room.

          <strong>Technical Implementation</strong><br /><br />
          <p>
          Once I identified the components I wanted to use and figured out the overall
          concept that I imagined, I thought it would be best to go step-by-step on implementing
          the components individually, in order. I also found very helpful documentation about how
          to set up the DHT11 and LCD Display onto Arduino on <a href="https://www.circuitbasics.com/how-to-set-up-the-dht11-humidity-sensor-on-an-arduino/">
          Circuit Basics ("HOW TO SET UP THE DHT11 HUMIDITY SENSOR ON AN ARDUINO")</a>, which I followed along.
          
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Red LED</strong><br /><br />
          I first set up the red LED. In order to turn the red LED on and off,
          I used the public Arduino example code called <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/tutorial/blink">
          blink</a>. I modified the code to match my schematic.

            />

              Figure 6: the close-up of the red LED circuit
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
          <br /><strong>DHT11 Sensor</strong><br /><br />
          Then I set up the DHT11 sensor (the Temperature and Humidity Module),
          which was not difficult to install, following the documentation (
          <a href="https://www.circuitbasics.com/how-to-set-up-the-dht11-humidity-sensor-on-an-arduino/">
          "HOW TO SET UP THE DHT11 HUMIDITY SENSOR ON AN ARDUINO"</a>).
          I first had to figure out which type of connection my DHT11 has.
          The DHT11 provided by the Arduino kit has a three pin connection,
          which does not require a 10K Ohms pull-up resistor to be manually placed. This is because
          the resistances are internal to the DHT11. Regardless, I did not have to calculate resistance
          because the datasheet informs us that 10K Ohms pull-up resistor is required.
          If I used a four pin connection, I would need to use a 10K Ohm pull-up resistor.
          Before I was able to use the sensor, I installed the 
          <a href="https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/DHTLib/">DHTLib Library</a>,
          which has all the functions needed to get the humidity and temperature readings from the sensor.
          Then, I uploaded the example program (provided from the same documentation) to the Arduino
          and read the temperature and humidity levels through serial monitor, which is a part of testing the DHT11 sensor.

          <p>
          <br /><strong>LCD Display</strong><br /><br />
          Setting up the LCD Display was the most challenging as it took
          the most time to implement and understand the entire circuitry. It can be overwhelming because
          there are a lot of connections to be familiar and keep track of. I used this documentation
          <a href="https://www.circuitbasics.com/how-to-set-up-an-lcd-display-on-an-arduino/">
          ("ARDUINO LCD SET UP AND PROGRAMMING GUIDE")</a> to get the LCD Display to work.
          It was important to know — or have a general sense of — the purpose of each connection used in the project.
          There are two connections that required resistors, in order to control for the settings of the LCD Display
          (i.e. the display's contrast and backlight brightness levels).
          Once I got all the connections set up, I printed "hello world" to test onto the LCD Display, using
          the example program given in the documentation.

          <br /><strong>Combining Components to Create Humidity Detector Prototype</strong><br /><br />
          Once I got the components individually working, I was ready to combine all the components together to create my humidity detector prototype.
          I modified the Arduino code example provided in <a href="https://www.circuitbasics.com/how-to-set-up-the-dht11-humidity-sensor-on-an-arduino/">
          Circuit Basics ("HOW TO SET UP THE DHT11 HUMIDITY SENSOR ON AN ARDUINO")</a>. The Arduino code example prints the humidity as well as the temperature
          onto the LCD Display, which I thought were both helpful values to understand the environmental condition of the room. I included the red LED logic to
          turn on the red LED when the humidity level for health and comfort is not between the range 30 to 50%.

          <strong>Designing the Enclosure</strong>
          <p>
            After I got my circuits working, I designed a small cardboard box enclosure for my circuits.
            I mounted the LCD Display, DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, and the red LED on top of the box,
            so I could visibly see these components. 
            I had to be careful to avoid damaging and/or disconnecting the hardware connections.
            After I was done creating the enclosure, I replaced the USB power
            input to a 9V battery input that is given in the Arduino kit. 
            Using a 9V battery power source is acceptable because the Ardunio
            internally sets the power to 5V.

          <strong>Implementation Tips</strong>
          <p>
          It is important to check the software and hardware connections.
          It is easier to build the humidity detector prototype in a step-by-step process.
          Try to get the components working individually, then combine it altogether.
          When something goes wrong and the components are not functioning as expected,
          figure out what the problem is. For instance, when my prototype did not work
          properly, I tested the components individually, checked whether or not my
          coding logic was appropriate, and made sure my connections were strong.
          If my software was correct, I knew that it had to be a hardware problem, and vice versa.
          When facing hardware problems, I also learned that it is good to keep
          in mind that internal connections of the wires can be weak,
          even if our wiring physically appears to be plugged in correctly.

            Special thanks to Nadya and Jasper for helping me debug the hardware side
            of my project, in other words, check the connections of my circuit.
            I realized how important strong connections are and how difficult it is
            to identify internal circuitry problems!
