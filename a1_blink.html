                    <strong>Assignment Overview:</strong>
                    Create a schematic for at least 3 LEDs connected to Arduino,
                    using the circuits from a breadboard. Limit the current flowing through the
                    LEDs using resistors, and calculate an appropriate resistance to use.
                    Arduino code should make each LED blink (able to blink independently).
                    Write firmware for the circuit that makes the LEDs blink in a pattern
                    and add comments to explain what the code does.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>What I did:</strong> I made 4 LEDs (two blue and red colored LEDs) blink
                    in a pattern that I wanted to try.
                    <br><br>
                    Before I started inserting the electronic components into the breadboard,
                    I calculated an appropriate resistance to use (equal to or less 20mA) with
                    the LEDs I've chosen. I used Ohm's Law, which we learned in class.

                <p>
                    <br>
                    Once I figured out which resistor I needed to use for blue and white LEDs (100 V/A),
                    I sketched out the schematics for where the components should be placed.

                    <br>
                    After I got the circuits set up, I manipulated the blink example code and
                    wrote my own firmwire to experiment with different blinking patterns.

/*
  Blink

  Turns on LEDs, repeatedly (modified example code that 
  is in the public domain).

  http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Blink
  
  Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. On
  the UNO, MEGA and ZERO it is attached to digital pin
  13, on MKR1000 on pin 6. LED_BUILTIN is set to the
  correct LED pin independent of which board is used.
  If you want to know what pin the on-board LED is
  connected to on your Arduino model, check the Technical
  Specs of your board at:
  https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Products
