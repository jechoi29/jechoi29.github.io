            <strong>Assignment Overview:</strong>
            Create a schematic, circuit, and code that uses a sensor (e.g.
            either the photoresistor or the thermistor) in a voltage divider to
            change the state of an LED. Explain values chosen in schematic
            description. Use analogRead(), analogWrite(), the map function, and
            an if-statement. Write something to serial port. Do not use the same
            message as the example code. Justify the values chosen in the code
            and what those values are corresponding to in the circuit!
            <br /><br />
            <strong>What I did:</strong> I made a blue LED light up when low
            light is detected (when it gets dark), but when bright light is
            detected, I made its light fade away. <br /><br />
            Before I started inserting the electronic components into the
            breadboard, I had a basic idea of what I wanted to engineer so I
            first sketched out the schematics for where the components should be
            placed.

          </figure>
          <p>
            <br />
            Then, I calculated a desired resistance of equal to or less 20mA
            with the LED I've chosen and calculated the voltage divider's
            outcomes if I used a 10K V/A resistor, using Ohm's and Voltage
            Divider Laws.
            <br />
            Once I figured out which resistor I needed to use, I chose 100 V/A
            for the blue LED, and 10K V/A for the photoresistor to be safe (I
            was able to work with the values at the voltage divider, so the 10K
            resistor were apt for what I was trying to do).

            <br />
            After I got the circuits set up, I manipulated the AnalogInOutSerial
            example code and wrote my own firmwire to replicate what I wanted to
            do and incorporates the requirements that were mentioned above.
            Before uploading my Arduino program into my Arduino, I tested it on
            Tinkercad. And, this is where I was able to see the sensor and
            output values as I manipulated the light being detected. I found
            that 935 was the midpoint sensor value between bright light (974)
            and low light (54) detection, so I knew that this would be the point
            were my blue LED light's behavior will change (light up versus fade
            away).
